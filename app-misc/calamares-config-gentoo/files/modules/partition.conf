# This setting specifies the LUKS generation (i.e LUKS1, LUKS2) used internally by
# cryptsetup when creating an encrypted partition.
#
# This option is set to luks1 by default, as grub doesn't support LUKS2 + Argon2id
# currently. On the other hand grub does support LUKS2 with PBKDF2 and could therefore be
# also set to luks2. Also there are some patches for grub and Argon2.
# See: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grub-improved-luks2-git
#
# Choices: luks1, luks2 (in addition, "luks" means "luks1")
#
# The default is luks1
#

# This setting determines if encryption should be allowed when using zfs.  This
# setting has no effect unless zfs support is provided.
#
# This setting is to handle the fact that some bootloaders(such as grub) do not
# support zfs encryption.
#
# The default is true
#
# allowZfsEncryption: true

# Initial selection on the Choice page
#
# There are four radio buttons (in principle: erase, replace, alongside, manual),
# and you can pick which of them, if any, is initially selected. For most
# installers, "none" is the right choice: it makes the user pick something specific,
# rather than accidentally being able to click past an important choice (in particular,
# "erase" is a dangerous choice).
#
# The default is "none"
#
initialPartitioningChoice: none
#
# Similarly, some of the installation choices may offer a choice of swap;
# the available choices depend on *userSwapChoices*, above, and this
# setting can be used to pick a specific one.
#
# The default is "none" (no swap) if that is one of the enabled options, otherwise
# one of the items from the options.
